This project is an ios application that allows the user to play a hangman game.
There are currently 2 modes in the game, single player and multiplayer mode. 
In single player mode, the user is given random words to guess and their score keeps 
increasing until they fail to guess  a word. The mutiplayer mode allows a user to enter 
a word and another user to guess the word. The game also has a high score board for
 the single player mode.
